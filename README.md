# Indian Classical Music Generation using LSTM
## Overview
This project aims to generate Indian classical music using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture known for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Indian classical music, with its rich melodic and rhythmic structures, poses a fascinating challenge for AI-driven music generation.

## Motivation
Indian classical music is deeply rooted in tradition and culture, characterized by intricate melodies (ragas) and rhythmic patterns (talas). By leveraging machine learning techniques like LSTM, we aim to explore the potential of AI in capturing the essence of Indian classical music and generating compositions that resonate with its aesthetic and cultural nuances.

## Methodology
Data Collection: We gather a diverse corpus of Indian classical music recordings in MIDI format. MIDI files encode musical notes, timing, and other musical information, making them suitable for training machine learning models.
Preprocessing: The MIDI files are preprocessed to extract musical features such as pitch, duration, and velocity. These features are then converted into a suitable input format for training the LSTM network.
Model Training: An LSTM network is trained on the preprocessed musical data to learn the underlying patterns and structures of Indian classical music. The network is optimized to generate coherent and expressive musical sequences.
Music Generation: Once trained, the LSTM network can generate new sequences of musical notes, emulating the style and characteristics of Indian classical music. These generated compositions can be further refined and customized to produce unique pieces.
## Dependencies
Python 3.x  
TensorFlow or PyTorch (for implementing LSTM networks)  
Music21 library (for MIDI file parsing and music processing)  
Other necessary libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.)     
## Usage
**Data Preparation**: Collect or download a dataset of Indian classical music in MIDI format.      
**Preprocessing**: Use the provided preprocessing scripts to extract musical features from the MIDI files and prepare the data for training.     
**Model Training**: Train the LSTM network using the preprocessed data. Tune hyperparameters such as network architecture, learning rate, and batch size for optimal performance.           
**Music Generation**: Utilize the trained model to generate new Indian classical music compositions. Experiment with different input parameters to explore the diversity of generated music.
